# Status For Systems

## Overview
Status For Systems is an open-source project designed to provide a status page for various systems and services.

This project is currently a work in-progress and is not yet fully functional.

## Background
A couple of years ago, I was looking for a status page solution that didn't cost a fortune and had good integrations with 
other services. I found a few options, but they were either too expensive or didn't have the features I needed. In the end, 
I decided to start on this project to fill that gap.

If you're a startup or a small business, this is probably for you once it's done. If you're an enterprise, I'd recommend waiting.

## Features
- Incident management

## Upcoming Features
- RSS feed for status updates
- Notifications (Slack, Discord, Email, etc...)
- Integrations with issue management systems (Jira, GitHub Issues, etc...)
- Probes for checking the status of services
- Metrics, uptime, and performance tracking
